## 6. Troubleshooting

-   **Cursor Jitter**: Try improving lighting conditions or moving closer/further from the webcam. Ensure a plain background behind your hand if possible.
-   **Gestures Not Recognized**: Make sure your hand is fully in view and gestures are performed clearly. Check lighting.
-   **Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working**: The application might need to be run with administrator/root privileges for the `keyboard` library to function correctly system-wide.
-   **Webcam Not Found**: Ensure your webcam is connected and not being used by another application. Try restarting the application.
